# Demo-Java-RestService

This is one of my historical project, not in maintain now, just for reference, and demo my experience.

This project is built by Java + Spring + Hibernate. It exposes RESTful APIs to front-end.

Main points implemented:
* Controllers base on spring-mvc.
* Validators base on spring-aop.
* Global exception handler.
* Individual email service.
* Email template support base on FreeMarker.
* SMS sender (need 3rd service provider)
* OR mapping base on Hibernate.
* Junit
* logback
* Maven

Note: I updated some codes, so this project cannot run directly.
